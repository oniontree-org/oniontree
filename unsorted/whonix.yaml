name: Whonix
description: Whonix is a free and open-source desktop operating system (OS) that is
  specifically designed for advanced security and privacy. Based on Tor, Debian GNU/Linux
  and the principle of security by isolation, Whonix realistically addresses common
  attack vectors while maintaining usability. Online anonymity and censorship circumvention
  is attainable via fail-safe, automatic and desktop-wide use of the Tor network,
  meaning all connections are forced through Tor or blocked.
